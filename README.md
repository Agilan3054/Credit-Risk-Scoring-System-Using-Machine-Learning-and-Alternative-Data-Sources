# Credit-Risk-Scoring-System-Using-Machine-Learning-and-Alternative-Data-Sources

## Description

Developed a machine learning model for assessing credit risk by analyzing alternative data sources such as transactional behavior, social media activity, and macroeconomic indicators in addition to traditional financial data. This system classifies borrowers based on credit risk scores, helping reduce defaults and optimize lending decisions.

## Key Technologies

- **Machine Learning**: XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM for credit risk classification
- **Data Engineering**: Data scraping using BeautifulSoup, feature engineering with PySpark
- **NLP for Alternative Data**: Sentiment analysis from borrower communications and social media using NLP techniques
- **Automated Reporting**: PowerBI dashboards for real-time monitoring and reporting of credit risk scores
